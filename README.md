sitnconquer
===========

Blank prototype for the sitnconquer game we are developing for our Videogames class.

Game Concept
The game is set in a public space with several tables. There are two players, each with a color.
Every specified time, a new person (of the color of the player) arrives for each player. 
Each player selects where it should sit. If the table was empty, it is conquered by the player whose person
got there. 
Players can also select a table and stand people up one by one and decide to move them all to another table.
If they move more people than those currently sitted, they win the table. 

The object of the game is to conquer all tables.
